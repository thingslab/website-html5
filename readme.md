#README
This repository contains the code for the new Things Lab [website](http://www.thingslab.cc/).

##Contribution
This repository uses [Bower](http://bower.io/) for front-end dependencies. Make sure to install all the dependencies as below whenever you `pull` from the repo:

```bash
bower install
```

To add new dependencies, follow this scheme:

```bash
bower install <dependency> --save
```

This would allow the dependencies to be saved into `bower.json`.
